# Controlling-of-generator-and-DC-motor
Control the angular velocity of a load to follow the input from the command potentiometer
1.Draw the block diagram of the system.
2.Do the modelling of the system using differential equations and derive the state space.
3.Simulink model of the sysytem.
4.responses of both open/close loop of the system.
5.compare stability, preformance and steady state error.
6.design a controller via state space and compare it to classical control method.
7.design an integral control to eliminate steady state error.
